## PART 1: INVARIANT SPECIFICATIONS

### I1: GRAPH TOPOLOGY PRESERVATION

**Claim:** 158 neurons and 102 synapses remain constant throughout execution.

**Verification Criteria:**
- VC1-A: Neuron registry snapshot at init ≡ final (count, IDs)
- VC1-B: Synapse registry snapshot at init ≡ final (count, IDs, connectivity)
- VC1-C: No unregistered neuron IDs appear in state logs
- VC1-D: Event queue never targets non-existent neurons
- VC1-E: Behavioral output uses only registered neuron IDs

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- Neuron ID validation on every state snapshot
- Event queue target verification before delivery
- Behavioral output source filtering

**Attack Surface:** Neuron aggregation, silent neuron deletion, aggregation layers

---

### I17: RECURRENT CONNECTIVITY PRESERVED

**Claim:** All feedback loops remain executable; cycles broken temporally via synaptic delays (≥1 ms minimum).

**Verification Criteria:**
- VC17-A: Backward synapses in registry
- VC17-B: Cycle topology unchanged (same edges at init and final)
- VC17-C: All synaptic delays > 0 ms
- VC17-D: Cycle latency ≥ 1 ms (round-trip minimum)
- VC17-E: Bidirectional firing observed in logs

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- Mandatory synaptic delays for all connections
- Event queue strictly forward-time ordering
- No synchronous (same-timestep) feedback

**Attack Surface:** Synapse silencing, delay removal, instantaneous feedback

---

### I18: TEMPORAL STATE PRESERVATION

**Claim:** State[t] deterministically derived from state[0..t] + inputs; identical inputs → identical outputs (deterministic replay).

**Verification Criteria:**
- VC18-A: Replay with same seed produces identical spike sequence
- VC18-B: ODE solver matches published benchmarks
- VC18-C: Event queue processing order deterministic
- VC18-D: No unlogged external randomness
- VC18-E: State snapshots contain all necessary information
- VC18-F: Stimulus sequence fully logged
- VC18-G: Floating-point precision controlled

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- Deterministic priority queue (timestamp, source_id)
- Seeded PRNG with fixed dt = 0.01 ms
- Complete state logging (tier 3)
- Fixed-order arithmetic for aggregations

**Attack Surface:** Random event ordering, external time dependencies, floating-point reordering

---

### I19: NEUROTRANSMITTER/RECEPTOR TRACEABILITY

**Claim:** Every spike carries NT type; every synapse carries receptor type; incompatible pairs explicitly rejected.

**Verification Criteria:**
- VC19-A: All synapses have assigned NT_type and receptor_type
- VC19-B: All (NT, receptor) pairs in COMPATIBLE_PAIRS table
- VC19-C: Spike NT consistent with source neuron synapses
- VC19-D: Event delivery NT/receptor validated
- VC19-E: Behavioral output NT traces complete
- VC19-F: All receptor types have kinetics implementations

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- Compatibility matrix enforcement at synapse creation
- Spike event payload includes NT and receptor type
- Kinetic model lookup before receptor activation
- Type checking at event delivery

**Attack Surface:** Incompatible pair assignment, unimplemented receptor types, kinetics mismatch

---

### I20: BEHAVIORAL OUTPUT TRACEABILITY

**Claim:** Every behavior traces to source neuron CAT-N-ID; every spike traces to source CAT-N-ID; no anonymous layers.

**Verification Criteria:**
- VC20-A: Behavior → source neuron path traceable
- VC20-B: No aggregate terms in traces (only CAT-N-### and CAT-S-###)
- VC20-C: All spike events have explicit source_neuron_id
- VC20-D: Trace reconstruction always possible
- VC20-E: Trace depth bounded ≤ 100 synapses
- VC20-F: Weight attribution conserves (sums to 1.0)
- VC20-G: All spike routing explicit (no NULL synapse_id)

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- ActionTrace logging with explicit source_neurons list
- Weight attribution calculation and validation
- Trace DAG acyclicity check
- Behavioral output filtering for aggregate terms

**Attack Surface:** Implicit aggregation, anonymous computation, circular traces, disconnected paths

### Audit Sign-Off Decision Matrix

#### Scenario 1: APPROVED
```
Condition: ALL attacks detected, ALL invariants verified
Evidence:
  ✓ Attack A1-E4: Detected (15/15)
  ✓ Invariant I1: Verified (5/5 criteria)
  ✓ Invariant I17: Verified (5/5 criteria)
  ✓ Invariant I18: Verified (7/7 criteria)
  ✓ Invariant I19: Verified (6/6 criteria)
  ✓ Invariant I20: Verified (7/7 criteria)
  
DECISION: APPROVED
Authority: ORCHESTRATOR-2
Scope: Phase 4 execution cleared for production
```

#### Scenario 2: CONDITIONAL
```
Condition: Most attacks detected, minor gap identified
Example: Floating-point rounding ε = 2e-6 (larger than specified 1e-6)
Evidence:
  ✓ Attacks A1-E4: Detected (except minor C2 tolerance issue)
  ✓ Invariant I18 (C2 branch): Conditional approval
  
DECISION: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
Conditions:
  1. Document floating-point tolerance: ε = 2e-6 ms
  2. Implement precision controls in critical path
  3. Re-test after fixes; final re-approval required
  
Authority: ORCHESTRATOR-2
Scope: Phase 4 execution approved with caveats
```

#### Scenario 3: BLOCKED
```
Condition: Attack undetected (defense bypassed)
Example: Attack B2 (synapse creation) not detected; CA-S-103 used but accepted
Evidence:
  ✗ Attack B2: UNDETECTED (unregistered synapse CAT-S-103 accepted)
  ✗ Invariant I1 (VC1-D): FAILED
  
DECISION: BLOCKED
Remedy Required:
  1. Implement event queue validation: verify all target synapses in registry
  2. Add retroactive synapse discovery check (VS-B3)
  3. Fail-fast on unknown synapse_id
  4. Re-test; all attacks must be detected before re-submission
  
Authority: ORCHESTRATOR-2
Scope: Phase 4 execution model REJECTED; remediation required
```

## PART 5: CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Event Queue Ordering is Critical

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Description:** If event queue uses random ordering (instead of deterministic priority), C1 attack succeeds undetected. This breaks I18 (temporal state preservation).

**Mitigation:** Implement strict priority queue with (timestamp, source_id) ordering. Verify in VS-C1 test.

**Evidence Artifact:** event_queue_order_check.txt

---

### Finding 2: Neuron Pooling is Silently Dangerous

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Description:** Implicit neuron aggregation (A1 attack) appears in state logs but not spike logs. Discrepancy between different logging types masks the aggregation.

**Mitigation:** Ensure all logging types (spike logs, state logs, behavior logs) use identical neuron IDs. VS-A1 catches this via registry reconciliation.

**Evidence Artifact:** log_audit.txt (spike log), state_log_clean (state snapshots)

---

### Finding 3: Synapse Silencing is Hard to Detect

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Description:** A synapse can be marked "delivery_enabled = false" in code without appearing in registry as deleted. It looks present but doesn't fire.

**Mitigation:** For all expected-to-fire synapses, verify delivery events in logs. VS-B1 checks this via postsynaptic event analysis.

**Evidence Artifact:** spike_transmission_audit.txt

---

### Finding 4: Floating-Point Consistency Must Be Enforced

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Different aggregation orders (e.g., synapse currents summed in different order) produce different rounding → different ODE results → different spike times. Not necessarily a bug, but non-deterministic if order varies.

**Mitigation:** Always sort inputs before aggregation. Use fixed-order summation. VS-C3 validates this.

**Evidence Artifact:** precision_audit.txt

---

### Finding 5: Behavioral Output Requires Explicit Traces

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Description:** If behavioral output source_neurons uses aggregate terms (e.g., "motor_cortex_layer_5" instead of individual CAT-N-IDs), traceability is lost and attacks E1 go undetected.

**Mitigation:** Enforce CAT-N-### format for all source neuron IDs. Filter out aggregate terms. VS-E1 catches violations.

**Evidence Artifact:** action_trace_audit.txt
