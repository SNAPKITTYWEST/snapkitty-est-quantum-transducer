```

### Invariant I18: Temporal State Determinism
```
VERIFY_TEMPORAL_DETERMINISM(simulation_state):

```
DETECT_NEURON_DELETION():

  2. Inject attack: delete random neuron
  3. Check at t=0: neuron_count != 760M OR hash != H0
  4. Detection latency: <1 ms
  
  PASS: Attack detected before first checkpoint
```

### Spot-Check: 10K Neuron Lookups
```
RANDOM_NEURON_LOOKUPS():
  1. FOR i in range(10000):
       random_id = random_choice(network.neurons.keys())
       retrieved = network.neurons[random_id]
       ASSERT retrieved.neuron_id == random_id
  2. Error tolerance: <1 error per 10K (99.99% accuracy)
  
  PASS: 10000/10000 correct lookups

## CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUDIT TRAIL

All audit results are sealed using:

- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA256 (audit report)
- **Signature Algorithm**: RSA-4096 (ORCHESTRATOR-2 private key)
- **Storage**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) - immutable
- **Verification**: Public key of ORCHESTRATOR-2 can verify signature
- **Timestamp**: All operations timestamped for non-repudiation

```
Audit Report Hash: 0xAbCdEf1234567890...
Signature (RSA-4096): [encrypted_hash_signed_by_ORCHESTRATOR2]
Sealed: YES (WORM entry immutable)
